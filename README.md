This is Project Three for SDMM -ToDo App
============================
### About
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Remember-have_fun-blue)

This TO-DO app is going to continue to build up your HTML/CSS & Javascript skills. Similar to your clock application, the focus of building this is functionality...NOT styling. So focus on getting new TO-DOâ€™s to show up and to check off TO-DOâ€™s. Donâ€™t worry about making everything look perfect. **Focus on simplicity and getting the app to work.**
Here is an example of a working [ToDo App](https://software-development-mastermind.github.io/to-do-example/)
